# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Part 1 of Second week's homework

Included is three .html files similar to the ones from the Basic-Portfolio assignment except there is no .css style page. Each file links to bootstrap's stylesheet. An image folder is also included, containing the profile picture, examples of work for the portfolio, and resized portfolio images specifically used for the thumbnails

I would like to have made the thumbnail links more responsive (hover effects and banners along the image similar to Week 1's assignment) but I was unsure of how to to that using the bootstrap CSS template approach. All feedback is appreciated
